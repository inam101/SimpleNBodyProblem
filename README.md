# SimpleNBodyProblem
A Windows Form based implementation of N Body problem using simple Physics equations, without calculus.
The physics and maths doesn't exceed 10th grade level. 

To start a simulation, just click Init button and then the Start/Stop button.
The simulation code and algorithm are not optimized, to keep things straight forward.
This is a gravity simulation and everybody knows that gravity is very weak force. Thereore the simulation seems very slow.
To speed things up, there is a slider at the right-side of the black screen with lable: Time Speed. Up and down the slider to speed things a little.
But it will take some time and speed to notice any changes on the black screen.
